# RathCoin-Cryptocurrency
A simple cryptocurrency implemented and deployed over the Ethereum Blockchain using Solidity, the programming language of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The code can be implemented to specify the Name of the Cryptocurrency, the max amount of Tokens, Decimals allowed and the symbol. This can then be used to send cryptocurrencies to anyone else on the Ethereum Blockchain using the public keys.

# Implementing the Code
* Open Remix online IDE. Upload the two files "RathCoin.sol" and "RathCoinInterface.sol"
* Select the right Compiler based on the Solidity version, for eg. for pragma ^0.4.18 you have to select "version:0.4.18+commit.9cf6e910.Emscripten.clang"
* The two files will be compiled on selection
